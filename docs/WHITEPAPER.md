## Sapphire Messenger: Communication in the New Era

In a world where every word and every message counts, we present to you Sapphire Messenger - a new word in the world of secure communications. The name "Sapphire" was chosen for a reason. Just as the sapphire symbolizes clarity, wisdom, and impenetrability, our messenger reflects these same values in the digital world.

Sapphire Messenger is more than just a messenger. It's your personal, secure space for freedom of speech and thought, where you can communicate without worrying about the security of your messages. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels confident and at ease, knowing that their personal life remains inviolable.

Sapphire Messenger is your private secret channel for communicating with friends, family, and colleagues. In this world, where confidentiality becomes increasingly valuable, we invite you to the world of Sapphire, where your personal life remains just that - personal.

## Why We Need This: The Necessity of Confidentiality in the Digital Age

In the modern world, where digital traceability has become the norm, confidentiality is no longer a privilege but a necessity. Messenger Sapphire is born from the understanding of this urgent need. We are committed to protecting your right to personal space and freedom of speech in the digital realm.

In a market where products are often developed with a focus on marketing benefits rather than user interests, Sapphire stands out with its emphasis on engineering solutions. We believe that quality and security are the results of engineering expertise, not marketing strategies.

In an era when open software is becoming not just a trend but an essential element of digital security, Sapphire emphasizes its commitment to the principles of openness and transparency. In a world where open messengers are a rarity, we offer an alternative that allows users full control over their data.


We are an open project, the essence of which is to create a messaging system that provides the highest possible degree of confidentiality. The openness of our project is a necessity that helps maintain user trust and the confidentiality of the project.

The openness of Sapphire Messenger allows us to go beyond just providing a secure platform. It creates a space for collaborative work, where everyone can participate in improving and developing the project, making it more reliable and transparent. We believe that community involvement and open exchange of ideas contribute to creating a system that truly meets users' needs for confidentiality.

This openness also demonstrates our commitment to honesty and transparency. In an era when data is often used for commercial purposes, we offer a path that puts user privacy first. Sapphire Messenger not only protects your messages but also gives you confidence that your personal information remains in safe hands.

Thus, Sapphire Messenger is not just a messenger. It's a movement towards a more secure and open world of digital communications, where every user has the opportunity to control their data and be confident in its security. We are committed to creating a future where confidentiality is not an option, but an integral part of digital communication.


### How We Stand Out from the Rest?

1. **Open Source Code**: Unlike many popular messengers, Sapphire Messenger is built on the principles of openness. Our source code is available for community review and participation, ensuring transparency and trust.

2. **Focus on Confidentiality**: We don’t just claim to offer confidentiality, we embody it in every aspect of our messenger. From message encryption to the protection of personal data, Sapphire Messenger puts your privacy first.

3. **Utilizing IPFS**: We are among the first to integrate IPFS technology into a messenger. This allows us to offer a unique distributed data storage system, enhancing security and reliability.

4. **Community and Collaborative Development**: Sapphire Messenger is not just a product of our team; it's a product developed with community participation. We value each contribution and strive for continuous improvement.

5. **Honesty and Transparency**: In an era of informational unreliability and marketing promises, we offer honesty. No hidden functions or catch. Just pure transparency and openness.

6. **Modern Encryption Methods**: We utilize the latest advancements in cryptography to secure your messages, ensuring that only you and your interlocutor have access to them.

7. **Responsible Data Usage**: At Sapphire Messenger, we respect your choices and right to personal information. We do not use your data for commercial purposes and ensure its complete protection.

These features distinguish Sapphire Messenger from other messengers and make it the ideal choice for those who value confidentiality, security, and openness.


### How Does It Work? 

Sapphire Messenger utilizes an advanced process of message encryption and storage to ensure maximum security and confidentiality. Here’s how it works:

1. **Message Encryption**: When user A sends a message to user B, they encrypt it using user B's public key. This ensures that only user B can decrypt the message.

2. **Sending to IPFS**: The encrypted message is then sent to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) – a decentralized network for data storage. IPFS returns a unique link to the message.

3. **Link Transmission**: The link to the message in IPFS is sent to user B via the Sapphire Messenger server.

4. **Reception and Decryption**: User B uses their private key to decrypt the link, accesses the message in IPFS, downloads, and decrypts it.

This process ensures that messages can only be read by their intended recipients, providing a high level of security and confidentiality for communication in Sapphire Messenger.


### Your Data

In Sapphire Messenger, we adhere to the principle of minimal data collection, limiting ourselves to only what is necessary for user identification and authorization. Our approach is aimed at providing a convenient user experience while simultaneously protecting your confidentiality.

We strive to ensure that marketers and metrics collection systems do not have access to the content of your conversations and personal data. There is no practice of selling user data in Sapphire Messenger.

Furthermore, we do not use authorization through third-party services such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others, to further strengthen the protection of your personal information. You can read more about the project rules in this document [PRINCIPALS.md]()

In Sapphire Messenger, we strive to collect only the most necessary data while ensuring maximum confidentiality and security for our users. Here is a detailed list of the data we collect:

1. **Username**: Used for identification in the system and interaction with other users.
2. **E-mail**: Necessary for account registration, access recovery, and important notifications.
3. **Crypto Wallet** Address: For integration with cryptocurrency payments and transactions.
4. **Password**: Your key to the account, which we store in an encrypted form.
5. **Online Status**: Indicates whether you are currently active in the app.
6. **Chats**: Although we store your chat history for the convenience of synchronization between devices, we do not have access to their content. Our goal is to eventually move away from storing chats on the server, transferring them to local storage without the possibility of cloud upload.
7. **Blocked Users**: This information is used to manage your contact list and restrict communication access. Plans are to implement this function locally on your device.
8. **Language** (lang): For automatic translation of the application interface into your preferred language.
Subscription: An optional section that includes information about you and your interests if you choose to provide it.


>[!NOTE] 
> We constantly review and adapt our data collection policy in line with current security and privacy requirements. It is important to emphasize that we never collect data that can directly reveal your identity, such as phone numbers, passport details, or geolocation. Our task is to ensure that every user feels protected and confidential while using Sapphire Messenger.





### Confidentiality & Anonymity

In Sapphire Messenger, we strive to maintain a balance between confidentiality and anonymity, paying special attention to each of these aspects. Our priority is confidentiality: we employ advanced technologies to ensure that personal data and user messages remain protected from unauthorized access.

While anonymity is an important focus for us, it remains a complex challenge that we plan to address in the future. We recognize that complete anonymity in the digital space faces numerous challenges, and we are actively exploring ways to implement it without compromising user security and convenience.

Currently, our goal is to create a reliable platform where everyone can feel safe, knowing their confidentiality is protected. At the same time, we continue to work on improving anonymity to offer our users even greater freedom and control over their personal information.

Our current goal is to offer a secure platform where users can feel confident about their privacy. While we continue to enhance user anonymity, our users' freedom and control over their personal information remain a top priority. We believe that this dedication to confidentiality, even at the expense of certain features, sets Sapphire Messenger apart in the digital communication space.However, we will try to make the messenger as convenient and at the same time confidential for users


### Idea & Implementers

Sapphire Messenger was conceived within the [Gyber Experiment](https://github.com/OpenDevCommune) community in 2023, stemming from the creative vision of an individual known as [Gybernaty](https://github.com/TheMacroeconomicDao). The idea was inspired by the ambition to develop a messenger that stands out for its security and confidentiality.

Since its inception, the project has evolved independently from the Gyber Experiment community due to differences with the experiment's initiator. The primary implementer and developer of the project is currently Nicki-afk. This document is being read in Nicki-afk's repository, where the ongoing development and refinement of Sapphire Messenger take place.

>It is important to note the fact that although sapphire develops separately from the Gybernaty community, it still indirectly relates to this community since it shares the vision and philosophy of this community


### Final Goal

The ultimate goal of the Sapphire project is not about making profits, gaining publicity, or attracting investments. Our primary mission is to create a product that provides users with the highest possible level of confidentiality. We are committed to ensuring that every user of Sapphire Messenger can be confident in the security of their personal data and conversations.

It is crucial to emphasize that Sapphire is not a product of any corporation and belongs to no one. This uniqueness sets our project apart in the digital communication world, where many solutions are controlled by large players. Our independence allows us to focus entirely on the interests and security of our users.

We are focused on developing technologies that protect the data and privacy of our users. By creating an environment for free communication without fears of interference or information leaks, we see our work not just as a technical task but as an important social project capable of changing the perception of security and confidentiality in the digital world.
