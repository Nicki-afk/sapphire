## Sapphire Messenger: Communication in the New Era

In a world where every word and every message counts, we present to you Sapphire Messenger - a new word in the world of secure communications. The name "Sapphire" was chosen for a reason. Just as the sapphire symbolizes clarity, wisdom, and impenetrability, our messenger reflects these same values in the digital world.

Sapphire Messenger is more than just a messenger. It's your personal, secure space for freedom of speech and thought, where you can communicate without worrying about the security of your messages.

## Why We Need This: The Necessity of Confidentiality in the Digital Age

In the modern world, where digital traceability has become the norm, confidentiality is no longer a privilege but a necessity. Messenger Sapphire is born from the understanding of this urgent need. We are committed to protecting your right to personal space and freedom of speech in the digital realm.

In a market where products are often developed with a focus on marketing benefits rather than user interests, Sapphire stands out with its emphasis on engineering solutions. We believe that quality and security are the results of engineering expertise, not marketing strategies.

In an era when open software is becoming not just a trend but an essential element of digital security, Sapphire emphasizes its commitment to the principles of openness and transparency. In a world where open messengers are a rarity, we offer an alternative that allows users full control over their data.


We are an open project, the essence of which is to create a messaging system that provides the highest possible degree of confidentiality. The openness of our project is a necessity that helps maintain user trust and the confidentiality of the project.

The openness of Sapphire Messenger allows us to go beyond just providing a secure platform. It creates a space for collaborative work, where everyone can participate in improving and developing the project, making it more reliable and transparent. We believe that community involvement and open exchange of ideas contribute to creating a system that truly meets users' needs for confidentiality.

This openness also demonstrates our commitment to honesty and transparency. In an era when data is often used for commercial purposes, we offer a path that puts user privacy first. Sapphire Messenger not only protects your messages but also gives you confidence that your personal information remains in safe hands.

Thus, Sapphire Messenger is not just a messenger. It's a movement towards a more secure and open world of digital communications, where every user has the opportunity to control their data and be confident in its security. We are committed to creating a future where confidentiality is not an option, but an integral part of digital communication.


### How We Stand Out from the Rest?

These features distinguish Sapphire Messenger from other messengers and make it the ideal choice for those who value confidentiality, security, and openness.


### How Does It Work? 

Sapphire Messenger utilizes an advanced process of message encryption and storage to ensure maximum security and confidentiality. Here’s how it works:

1. **Message Encryption**: When user A sends a message to user B, they encrypt it using user B's public key. This ensures that only user B can decrypt the message.

2. **Sending to IPFS**: The encrypted message is then sent to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) – a decentralized network for data storage. IPFS returns a unique link to the message.

3. **Link Transmission**: The link to the message in IPFS is sent to user B via the Sapphire Messenger server.

4. **Reception and Decryption**: User B uses their private key to decrypt the link, accesses the message in IPFS, downloads, and decrypts it.

This process ensures that messages can only be read by their intended recipients, providing a high level of security and confidentiality for communication in Sapphire Messenger.
